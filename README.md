## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive

### What I learned

I practiced with the grid system and it helped me remember and get better at using it.

### Continued development

I have to keep training my eye so that the websites look better and with an optimal size for each element in it, I also have to keep practicing the use of grids because I forget the properties they have and how to implement it.
